## How It Works

### Client-Side Calculation
Statistics are calculated **in real-time in your browser** as you type, providing instant feedback without server roundtrips.

### On Save (Hook: `on_note_save`)
When a note is saved, the plugin:
1. Parses the markdown content
2. Calculates all statistics
3. Logs key metrics to Docker logs (for monitoring)

### Hooks Used
- `on_note_save` - Logs stats to Docker after save

---

## Viewing Statistics

### In the UI
1. Open any note
2. Look at the **bottom** of the screen
3. Click to expand/collapse the stats panel
4. Statistics update in real-time as you type

### In Docker Logs
```bash
docker-compose logs -f | grep "📊"
```

Example output:
```
📊 projects/website.md:
   1,234 words | 6m read | 89 lines
   15 links (5 internal)
   8/12 tasks completed
```

---

## Configuration

No configuration needed. The plugin works out of the box.

### Customization (Optional)

To change reading speed calculation, edit `note_stats.py`:

```python
# Line 36
words_per_minute = 200  # Change to your reading speed
```

---

## Architecture

### Client-Side (Frontend)
- Statistics are calculated in JavaScript (`app.js`)
- Updates in real-time as you type
- No API calls required for stats display
- Instant feedback, zero latency

### Server-Side (Backend)
- Plugin logs stats to Docker when notes are saved
- Uses `on_note_save` hook
- Provides monitoring and tracking
- No API endpoints needed

---

## Use Cases

### 📝 Writing Goals
Track word count to meet daily writing targets.

### ⏱️ Content Planning
Estimate reading time for blog posts or documentation.

### ✅ Task Management

### 🔗 Link Auditing
Find orphaned notes or track reference density.

## Troubleshooting

**Issue:** Stats not showing in UI
- **Check:** Is plugin enabled? `curl http://localhost:8000/api/plugins`
- **Check:** Hard refresh browser (Ctrl+Shift+R)
- **Fix:** Save the note again to recalculate stats

**Issue:** Wrong statistics
- **Cause:** Complex markdown formatting
- **Fix:** Plugin uses regex parsing - very complex markdown may vary
- **Note:** Statistics are estimates, not exact counts

**Issue:** Performance on large notes
- **Note:** Plugin is optimized for notes <100KB
- **For large files:** Stats calculation may take a moment on first save

## Technical Details

### Calculation Methods

**Words:** Split on whitespace, excluding code blocks  
**Reading Time:** `words / 200 minutes`

**Tasks:** Match `- [ ]` and `- [x]`  
**Code Blocks:** Match ` ```language ` ` fences  
**Headings:** Match `#`, `##`, `###` at line start  

### Performance
- **Client-side calculation** - Zero latency, no server roundtrips
- **Real-time updates** - As you type, stats refresh instantly
- **Lightweight** - Typical calculation: <10ms
